We can use the optimization above and take it a step further by hashing every single suggestion to a possible list of completions, where we would ultimately be trading space for performance. A NoSQL database implementation (i.e Redis)  would be ideal for something like this. But for the purposes of this, simply using a NoSQL database instead of implementing my own data structure from scratch would qualify as cheating."
